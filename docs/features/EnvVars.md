# Env Vars

Reads and optionally writes environment variables on the remote host without launching a shell session.

## Features
- Lists current variables with their values.
- Allows editing or injecting values when permitted.
- Avoids a full interactive shell to reduce exposure.

## Basic Workflow
1. Open the Env Vars workspace.
2. Fetch the agent environment listing.
3. Edit or add values and save when configuration changes are needed.
