# Notes

Attaches free-form observations, reminders, or escalation history to each agent so context stays with the target.

## Features
- Stores operator-authored notes alongside every client record.
- Persists entries across sessions so long-running investigations maintain context.

## Basic Workflow

2. Read or update entries, then save to keep the log current.
