# CMD

Offers an interactive shell on the agent for running commands, seeing output, and automating repairs.

## Features
- Streams stdout and stderr as commands execute so operators know what is happening.
- Displays command history for reruns and auditing.
- Can run commands with the same privileges as the agent process.

## Basic Workflow
1. Launch the CMD workspace for the selected client.
2. Enter and send commands while watching their output appear live.
3. End the session when troubleshooting is complete.
