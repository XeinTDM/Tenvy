# Client Chat

Lets operators exchange short messages with the remote user to coordinate actions or relay instructions.

## Features
- Supports two-way chat with timestamps for accountability.
- Queues messages while the agent is offline so content is not lost.
- Logs conversations for later auditing or review.

## Basic Workflow
1. Open the Client Chat panel for the agent.
2. Type and send a message through the controller.
3. Continue the dialogue or close the panel when finished.
