# Options

Hosts configuration toggles and policies so deployments can tailor which modules operators can access.

## Features
- Groups toggles by module or capability for quick oversight.
- Persists policy-driven defaults to keep sensitive tools locked down.
- Applies changes immediately so every operator sees the same controls.

## Basic Workflow
1. Open the Options page in the admin console.
2. Review current feature availability and flip flags as needed.
3. Save the configuration so the controller UI reflects the policy.
