# Clipboard

Synchronizes clipboard contents between controller and agent so snippets can be shared without file transfers.

## Features
- Pulls clipboard content from the remote session for local pasting.
- Pushes local clipboard text to the agent instantly.
- Optionally preserves a short history for repeated reuse.

## Basic Workflow
1. Open the Clipboard tool while connected to the client.
2. Copy text locally to push it, or request the agent clipboard contents.
3. Close the panel once the exchange is finished.
