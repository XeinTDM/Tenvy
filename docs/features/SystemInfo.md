# System Info

Summarizes hardware, OS, uptime, network, and sensor telemetry so operators quickly understand a host's state before acting.

## Features
- Aggregates CPU, memory, disk, OS, and uptime metrics into a single view.
- Highlights network addresses, latency, and sensor readings for fast triage.

## Basic Workflow
1. Open the System Info workspace for a client from the controller.
2. Review the refreshed telemetry and decide what to document or launch next.
