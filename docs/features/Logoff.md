# Logoff

Logs the current user out so another administrator or user can take control safely.

## Features
- Ends the active desktop session cleanly.
- Preserves system state for the next login.
- Useful before handing the machine to another operator.

## Basic Workflow
1. Trigger Logoff from the power controls.
2. The agent signs the user out and returns to the login screen.
3. Proceed once the host is ready for the next session.
